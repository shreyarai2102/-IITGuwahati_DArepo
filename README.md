# Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

This is the Capstone Project for Summer Analytics 2025, organized by the Consulting & Analytics Club with Pathway. The project aims to develop a dynamic pricing system for 14 urban parking lots using real-time data, Python, Pandas, NumPy, Pathway, and Bokeh visualizations.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Build a pricing model for each lot that updates prices live based on demand, competition, and conditions like traffic or special events.
- **Problem**: Static prices cause issues like packed or empty lots, so dynamic pricing balances usage.
- **Approach**: Implement from scratch and visualize with Bokeh.

## Data
- Covers 14 parking lots over 73 days, sampled every 30 minutes (8:00 AM to 4:30 PM).
- Includes vehicle types (cars, bikes, trucks), traffic congestion levels, special day flags (holidays/events), and demand variations.
